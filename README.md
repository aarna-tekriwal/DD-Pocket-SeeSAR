Acknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Mr. Hannes St√§rk and Mr. Michael Plainer for their support throughout the process and for teaching us about DiffDock and DiffDock-Pocket. We would like to thank Drew University for providing the facilities used during the Governor's School of New Jersey program in the Sciences. Thank you to Dr. Cincotta for his guidance during our project and for contributing to our daily mindset and real-world experience. Thank you to Ian Weitz, Visvam Rajesh, Kaleb Yong, and Yeji Kim for assistance with data collection. We appreciate Katerina Pouathas and Joel Moses for their coordination and assistance with the project as a whole. Finally, thank you to the Overdeck Family Foundation, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, and the New Jersey Office of the Secretary of Higher Education for the essential funding that has offered the GSNJS to thousands of students across the past 41 years. Without their help, there would be no research to begin with, so once again, thank you to the Overdeck Family Foundation, Novartis, and the New Jersey Office of the Secretary of Higher Education for supporting all the scholars' passion for science.
